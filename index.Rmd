## Objectives/Rationale


The basic objective was to develop and deploy a prediction model that could form the framework for a range of applications : from water useage, to the mean time before failure (MTBF) of machine parts.

Prediction Models are applied in a wide range of fields - especially given the "explosion" of data being generated today.  Monitoring data is particularly useful here, as the number variables being electronically monitored, the accuracy, and the sampling rate lends itself to fairly accurate results - using established statistical techniques.

## Objectives (cont'd...)

Implications for Unified Maintenance Planning in large-scale industries such as utilities are clear.  The mtbf of say conductor joints or steam boiler parts (disparate sectors of the utility) can be estimated on a central platform available to a range of professionals.  Established datasets with performance information under different conditions would be regularly sourced from teh websites of authorities such as US Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute.

The Potential Applications are Immense

## Choice of the Model - The Base Study

A 2013 study done on the Wei River Basin in China looked at the factors affecting domestic water consumption in rural households (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3745410/)

Factors such as water supply pattern and vegetable garden area were found to be highly correlated with consumption.  The study assisted with improving the safety and access of water supply to rural China...but also served to birth the idea for this project. However, it was used only as a guide in creating the model.

### Shortcomings of the App

Following were the problems encountered when building the model and the steps taken to mitigate them:

1. Problem: Appropriate Dataset to train the model was unavailable
Work Around: Sample dataset created using random number generator

2. Problem: Debugging the errors due to coercion was unending.  
Work Around: A threshold of 10 was "hard-wired" into the code instead of generating a prediction using a random forest model

As a result the only entry affecting the outcome is the last (the monthly consumption)

##  Description of the App (as originally intended)

Five inputs are taken using a mix of radio buttons, numerical input boxes and text input boxes (see below).  A random Forest Model is built using data downloaded from Data.gov, and an expected consumption predicted - which is compared with actaul amount entered to determine the likelihood of a leak.  


```{r opts.label="shiny"}
slidifyUI(
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            numericInput("ni.mem", label="Number of Persons in Household",
                         0, min=1, max=30, step=1),
            
            radioButtons("rb.gar", label="Do you have a Vegetable Garden ?",
                         c("Yes" = 1,
                           "No" = 0)),
            
            radioButtons("rb.rur", label="Do you live in the City ?",
                         c("Yes" = 1,
                           "No" = 0)),
            
            textInput("ti.acr", label="Size of Premises (in acres)"),
            
            textInput("ti.use", label="What is your Monthly water consumption (in gallons)"),
            
            submitButton("Submit")
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
        )
    )
)

```
